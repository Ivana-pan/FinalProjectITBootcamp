## Final_project_IT_Bootcamp 
was a way to roundup the three-month course by doing an automation test of a website by choice. 
I have chosen to automate the demoqa.com website, due to its sole purpose of providing variouys functionalities for testing. 

This website provides everything from basic .click() functions, to .dragAndDrop() functions and I thought they will be perfect to illustrate my abilities in the automated process of testing
